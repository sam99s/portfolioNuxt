          My work experience currently consists of two stages in the IT field.
          Meanwhile, my projects are distributed throughout my career, having
          created several since 2020. In them you can see applied technologies
          such as .NET, Vue.js, React.js, SQL, among others, by entering the
          corresponding repositories.

          Throughout my life I was linked to labor terms. This is something that
          I carry implicitly, since from an early age I identified myself with
          productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before definitely entering the world of IT, I spent 5 years in the
          world of sales, which taught me the value that I carry as a standard:
          perseverance.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this day, thanks to everything I have learned, I am determined to
          fight for my personal growth, responsibly fulfilling all the proposed
          objectives.
