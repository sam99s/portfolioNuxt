          <h4 class="my-5">Have I attended college?</h4>
          <p>
            Yes, I attended the National Technological University - CÃ³rdoba
            Regional Faculty. In the same, I studied for two years (2017 - 2018)
            the career of Engineering in Information Systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those years I discovered my passion for programming and creating
            systems and organizations. For that reason, I decided to take a
            little over a year to find out where I was headed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rest is a great story to hear, you can do that by contacting me.
