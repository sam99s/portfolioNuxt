          Without a doubt, all developers have more facilities for a specific
          field, in relation to their peers. Currently, that area I feel is from
          the Front End side, specifically with JavaScript Vanilla and Vue.js.

          <p>
            At the end of high school, I made the decision to start studying
            Engineering at the UTN - FRC. I have loved technology since I was
            very young, although it was always on par with sports. Ultimately,
            it won and I choose to enter the world of IT.
          </p>
          <p>
            Realizing I didn't have a clear goal, I decide to take a year to
            find myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            When 2020 started, I knew software was a part of me. And from that
            moment, my head does not stop thinking about producing code.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Python fundamentals since 2017, move on to another
            object-oriented language... JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the year, study at Platzi. Then in 2021 I took 3 courses
            at Coderhouse and finally I returned to Platzi throughout this year
            to specialize in my passions.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal for 2023 is to enter the Software Engineering career.

          <p>
            SQL is so far the tool I most want to improve in the short term.
            When I found this tool in my current job, I realized how powerful it
            is over non-relational databases.
          </p>
          <p>
            From my perspective, I will continue to focus on learning relational
            databases, but without closing the doors to the opposite path, since
            they are very useful in other cases.

        <v-col cols="12">
          <p>
            As my actuality weighs more on the .NET side, with Nuxt.js I focus
            on making websites like this portfolio. The truth is that it doesn't
            cost me much, since I program about 6 hours a day in my work with
            Vue.js. But the other reality is that there is always something new
            to learn, and Nuxt.js came for those reasons.

            So far I have been reading the documentation and creating code.
            However, I plan to take the courses at platzi at the end of the .NET
            learning path. And since I can't miss the practice, I also plan to
            do another E-commerce project with this tool.

          <p>
            Over the years I realized the importance of this language. In 2021 I
            set myself the goal of speaking English fluently in 2023 and thus be
            able to take that great leap on a personal level.
